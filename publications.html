                                    <p>Assessing sunlight conditions in urban environments is crucial, as high-quality natural light is essential for human health and well-being while supporting the production of clean and affordable energy. This systematic review examines the current state of research on solar access in urban and neighborhood contexts, identifying key variables and the impact of urban morphology on indoor natural light levels and outdoor solar energy potential. Using the PRISMA protocol, 202 articles were selected, categorized based on thematic and spatial classifications, and their validation methods critically assessed. Key findings from the reviewed articles regarding the impact of urban morphology on solar access are presented and categorized by theme. Finally, the dependent and independent variables in the studies and the validation results were analyzed. The findings indicate that most studies at the urban scale have focused more on outdoor solar energy potential, with fewer studies examining indoor natural light conditions. Building density emerged as the most frequently investigated morphological parameter. Additionally, the review highlights the scarcity of studies that simultaneously consider indoor and outdoor spaces and jointly assess indoor-outdoor solar performance. Although approximately 25% of the studies included validation procedures, direct comparisons were challenging due to the need for standardized validation protocols.</p>

                                    <p>Over the past two decades, global greenhouse gas emissions have surged, leading to rising sea levels and climate change. Solar energy has emerged as an excellent solution to this problem. This study aims to assess daylight availability and energy consumption in urban canyons and blocks in a semi-arid climate while exploring the correlation between the heterogeneity of urban morphological parameters and key research variables. The study employed field measurements and simulations using Ladybug Tools and UMI. Data were collected from urban canyons and blocks in three areas, amounting to 1,366,982 m2. The findings indicate that areas with abundant greenery and H/W ratios exceeding 1.8 experience the most significant shading effects in urban canyons. Selecting suitable trees and placing them in strategic locations can enhance energy efficiency. Furthermore, broad urban canyons (H/W < 0.5) receive four times more solar radiation than narrow urban canyons (H/W > 1.8) with high tree density, peaking at 240 kWh/m2 during summer. In urban blocks, rooftops have the highest solar potential, with imbalances between building heights and interbuilding shading as factors that reduce solar capabilities. Tree coverage significantly affects the solar potential of facades, with some urban blocks receiving less than 5,000 kWh/m2 of solar radiation on the southern facades each month. Finally, this study examined the impact of heterogeneity within urban morphological parameters on the principal research variables. The results indicate that the heterogeneity observed in urban morphological parameters affects daylight availability and energy consumption within urban blocks.</p>

                                    <p>Proper sunlight access has a positive impact on the physical and mental health of citizens, as well as on reducing energy consumption. This capacity may be limited by inappropriate urban morphology, and urban canyons and buildings are deprived of proper daylight. The purpose of this research is to study the current solar potential on the surface of the canyons and buildings and the effect of urban morphology parameters on the amount of each of the main variables of the research in Ilam, Iran. First, solar radiation, daylight illuminance, and air temperature were measured at different points of the studied canyons for three days. After that, the studied area was modeled with Rhino-Grasshopper software, and simulation was done using Ladybug Tools and UMI plugin. The results showed that the amount of daylight available in most canyons is low. Less than 30 % of the canyon’s surfaces benefited from 6 h of direct sunlight during the measurement. The simulation results for the 62 studied buildings showed that the highest amount of daylight is related to buildings with a height of more than 10 m. 56 % of the buildings had an annual solar radiation of less than 500 mw/m2. The roofs of the buildings received the most radiation, accounting for 72 % of the total radiation. By examining the parameters of urban morphology, it was found that the most influential parameter on the amount of solar radiation was the floor area, and the height of the buildings had the most influence on energy consumption.</p>
